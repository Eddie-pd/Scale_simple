# Scale_simple
Using HX711 module and library to measure weight and display the weight on LCD. Fun project where i learned a lot. 
Comments on code is partly in Swedish and I should metion that most of the code comes from the HX711 library and from the inbuilt LCD-library in the Arduino IDE. Don't really know how copyright works but here is the copyright statement of the creator of the HX711 library(https://github.com/olkal/HX711_ADC):
